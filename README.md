# helloworld-anyware
Non-exhausive list of examples of running HelloWorld on anything that has a CPU and firmware

## Intro
You're probably viewing this text using a computer(PC, laptop, mobile phone or tablet). However, you're actually not doing so with a single computer, but with many computers. This is true for any modern PC or mobile device, because almost any peripheral/gadget today includes its own CPU, RAM, ROM and runs a firmware code. In short, they are computers on their own.  

`helloworld-anyware` aims at reminding this simple yet possibly not well-known fact, by attempting to run a basic program on CPUs inside ubiquitous hardwares(e.g. USB Flash Drives, Wi-Fi cards, Bluetooth adapters, SSDs, stuff on laptop motherboards), which proves the existence of these cores.  

## Usage
Each hardware/peripheral has its own way to build(different CPU architectures), load(different DFU/ISP implementations) and run(different `output devices`, such as an LED) a HelloWorld. Please refer to chip-specific description for details. Find your target using the tables below.
